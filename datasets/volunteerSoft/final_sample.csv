About PANDEMIC PROFESSORS, INC. Location: 512 W 156th St., Apt 22, New York City, NY 10032, US Mission Statement: The mission of Pandemic Professors is to facilitate free tutoring to children in low-income communities impacted by the pandemic. Description: At Pandemic Professors (Pan Prof), we believe all K-12 students deserve an opportunity to receive free supplemental learning through private tutoring, in order to help them remain on track and meet their educational goals. Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors. Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices. Together with our partners, Pan Prof combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pan Prof provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.";['General Education', 'Tutoring', 'Literacy / Reading', 'Math / Science Instruction', 'Reading / Writing', 'STEM'];0;Education;[{'preferredLabel': 'show initiative', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We are looking for coding tutors', 'reasonForLabel': 'Looking for proactive tutors.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'apply knowledge of philosophy, ethics and religion', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'Our philosophy not only supports academic achievement but also emphasizes the importance of socio-emotional health.', 'reasonForLabel': 'Philosophy and ethics in tutoring approach.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'accept criticism and guidance', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We offer guidelines and support.', 'reasonForLabel': 'Guidance for tutors is provided.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'manage frustration', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We are here to support each other through this time as well and hope you join us!', 'reasonForLabel': 'Supporting others during challenging times.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'think critically', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'Teaching others is a great way to improve your own skills.', 'reasonForLabel': 'Improving skills through teaching.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'show empathy', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We are here to support each other through this time as well and hope you join us!', 'reasonForLabel': 'Empathy in supporting others.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'negotiate compromises', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We are looking for coding tutors, as we have seen the benefits and need for under-resourced students to gain skills related to the tech industry.', 'reasonForLabel': 'Negotiating needs of students.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'cope with stress', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'We are here to support each other through this time as well and hope you join us!', 'reasonForLabel': 'Support during stressful times.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'work efficiently', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'Flexible schedule: volunteer any day of the week, any time of day, wherever you are!', 'reasonForLabel': 'Efficient scheduling flexibility.'}, {'preferredLabel': 'think creatively', 'verbatimQuoteForLabel': 'Teach at many levels, from introductory coding in languages like Scratch to more advanced levels (e.g., Python, Java)', 'reasonForLabel': 'Teaching various skill levels.'}];6;5202;['show initiative', 'apply knowledge of philosophy, ethics and religion', 'accept criticism and guidance', 'manage frustration', 'think critically', 'show empathy', 'negotiate compromises', 'cope with stress', 'work efficiently', 'think creatively']

Students join us as Sophomores, where they build up their academic foundations in math, science, reading, writing and critical thinking, and learn key life skills, like leadership and public speaking. As Juniors, our students focus on improving standardized test scores, managing stress and exploring colleges. During the summers after their sophomore and junior years, we encourage and support our students with finding summer programs at different colleges around the country to push them out of their comfort zones and ready them for college. Finally, as Seniors, our students focus heavily on showcasing their best selves in their college applications and learning more key skills that will ensure that they don’t just graduate from college, but that they thrive during their experience. We also support them with learning about both traditional and creative ways of paying for college, so that finances don't become a barrier to considering a great school. We’re looking for volunteers to help us with every part of this program from tutoring to mentoring to managing programs. At the heart of our organization are people committed to making an impact in education and these students’ lives.
