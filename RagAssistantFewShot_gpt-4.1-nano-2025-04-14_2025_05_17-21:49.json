Thank you! Background: Pandemic Professors, a 501c3 organization, was founded in April 2020 with the mission of facilitating free online tutoring to students in underserved communities affected by the pandemic. We are a 100% volunteer-based organization. Our philosophy not only supports academic achievement but also emphasizes the importance of socio-emotional health. We rely on committed volunteers who have a passion for education and are dedicated to offering academic support to students at risk of falling behind. Your contribution is crucial in this endeavor!  You will interact with families and help students perform and learn! Join our organization and help us empower our students as we lay a foundation for lifelong learning. Being an online tutor: As a tutor, you are the lifeblood of this organization and are the one delivering services. We will pair you with a student who needs support in whichever standard K-12 subjects you want to teach (i.e., English, math, science, social studies, languages). You will interact with families and help your student(s) perform and learn! We are looking for coding tutors, as we have seen the benefits and need for under-resourced students to gain skills related to the tech industry. We are also looking for ESL tutors to support our growing Spanish-speaking population. To apply as a tutor, please copy and paste this link to your browser to reach us directly. (It only takes 2 mins to fill out!):  https://forms.gle/Q7UgbKVSwyCBNkfA7 Application Requirements: - College Transcript - Online Mandated Reporter Training - Professional Reference(s) Volunteer Requirements: - 2 or more hours per week commitment (flexibility for job requirements, midterms and finals) - Tutoring experience is helpful but not required. We offer guidelines and support. Responsibilities: - Engage and support students in their learning journey, covering subjects based on individual student needs - Collaborate with other volunteers and program coordinators to ensure effective tutoring sessions - Maintain records of student progress and provide feedback to students and supervisors Benefits of joining Pandemic Professors: -Improve diversity & inclusion in the tech industry by fostering hard skills and a sense of belonging in students from communities who are historically under-represented. -Learn by teaching! Teaching others is a great way to improve your own skills. Teach at many levels, from introductory coding in languages like Scratch to more advanced levels (e.g., Python, Java) -Flexible schedule: volunteer any day of the week, any time of day, wherever you are! We have volunteers from around the globe and students in many different time zones. -Get recognized for your volunteer work with letters of recommendation for college, grad school; references for job applications; and more!

If you would like to volunteer as a tutor, are interested in volunteer staff positions or have questions of any kind, please contact community.outreach@pandemicprofessors.org. About PANDEMIC PROFESSORS, INC. Location: 512 W 156th St., Apt 22, New York City, NY 10032, US Mission Statement: The mission of Pandemic Professors is to facilitate free tutoring to children in low-income communities impacted by the pandemic. Description: At Pandemic Professors (Pan Prof), we believe all K-12 students deserve an opportunity to receive free supplemental learning through private tutoring, in order to help them remain on track and meet their educational goals. Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors. Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices. Together with our partners, Pan Prof combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring. Pan Prof provides effective tools for students to complete their K-12 education until the educational gap is resolved. We sincerely hope you consider joining us to improve the lives of students adversely affected by poverty and the pandemic.",

      "input": "Looking for volunteers for the 2025-2026 school year. To learn more and apply, visit: http://www.mindsmatterbay.org/join/ ABOUT OUR PROGRAM Minds Matter Bay Area is a 100% volunteer-run, educational non-profit that provides low-income students access to strong mentors, instructors and leaders, who help broaden their worldview and prepare them for college and beyond. Students join us as Sophomores, where they build up their academic foundations in math, science, reading, writing and critical thinking, and learn key life skills, like leadership and public speaking. As Juniors, our students focus on improving standardized test scores, managing stress and exploring colleges. During the summers after their sophomore and junior years, we encourage and support our students with finding summer programs at different colleges around the country to push them out of their comfort zones and ready them for college. Finally, as Seniors, our students focus heavily on showcasing their best selves in their college applications and learning more key skills that will ensure that they don’t just graduate from college, but that they thrive during their experience. We also support them with learning about both traditional and creative ways of paying for college, so that finances don't become a barrier to considering a great school. We’re looking for volunteers to help us with every part of this program from tutoring to mentoring to managing programs. At the heart of our organization are people committed to making an impact in education and these students’ lives. At Minds Matter Bay Area, our mentees come first, but our strong community comes in at a close second. Many of our volunteers form lasting friendships and embark on new endeavors together. Whether we’re discussing the latest trends in education over dinner or picnicking in Golden Gate Park, our community knows how to get things done and have fun while doing it. We invite you to join our community and our cause. VOLUNTEER COMMITMENT The opportunity to make an impact on a student’s life comes with important responsibilities. When working with youth, one of the key components to building trust is just showing up. Commitment is key with our program-your presence, proactive communication, and conscientiousness are what makes Minds Matter Bay Area work. Sessions take place from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM every Saturday during the school year (August through May, with breaks following standard school holidays) For Sophomores and Juniors, instructional programs take place from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and mentoring from 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM For Seniors, college application prep takes place from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM We require a minimum attendance of 80% of Saturday sessions (approx. 20 of 25 weeks from August through May) and advanced notice of planned absences Building strong relationships with a student is vital for their success and growth, so we strongly prefer a three-year commitment, though we require a minimum of one year INSTRUCTORS The instructional component of our programs is designed to equip students with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for achieving academic success at school and in their standardized tests. Our instructors serve as guides and role models for our students, encouraging them to deepen their knowledge base and to enjoy the process of learning. Instructors take on a variety of different roles in our organization: leading a class on a subject area, teaching the SAT/ACT, and developing and delivering workshops on close reading, critical thinking, and statement writing skills for our students and their mentors. We will work with you to find a role that best fits your skills and experience. What we look for: Presentation and facilitation skills appropriate to a small group and/or classroom setting Depth of knowledge and passion for a particular subject Ability to take a complex concept and simplify it, so that anyone can learn it Unfettered curiosity for how things work-especially when it comes to academics and tests Passion for setting goals and gaining concrete results Ability to work in a team and navigate ambiguity Prior experience designing a curriculum and instructional materials is a plus MENTORS Each student is matched with two mentors, who work closely to help their student become well-rounded and navigate the college experience from application to graduation. Mentors work with their students to explore different majors and career paths and learn a variety of skills, like writing resumes and personal statements, managing time and stress, and presenting and discussing a perspective. Our mentors serve as positive role models and catalysts for the students, encouraging them to fulfill their full potential. What we look for: Ability to hold a high bar and set stretch goals that mentees can achieve Knows how to listen and ask the right questions to build trust in a relationship, including creating a safe space for difficult conversations and being available outside of session Inquisitive and curious about what motivates and excites people Adaptable to a wide variety of personality types, from introverts to extroverts; youth to adults Will take initiative, solve problems, be optimistic-but-realistic, collaborative and reliable Prior mentorship experience with low-income high school students is a plus To learn more and apply, visit: http://www.mindsmatterbay.org/join/",

We already have a list of schools (about 9 to 10), that are on our to-contact list and some we have engagements with already but we want to do a round of outreach to stay in touch and so that we remain updated on their current status and the wellbeing of staff and students. The schools have Parent Centers which we feel is the best channel to make contact through whether via email or phone. The interested volunteers would be provided a brief showcasing of what the inquiry entails for each school and would then take note and share it with our main contact. This transaction and relationship with the school(s) is important so that we can maintain the dialog and further improve our mission of enhancing the schooling experience. The more we know, the more we can do!",

We are anticipating around 200 patrons that will enjoy a catered dinner, presentations from our guest speakers, a silent auction, and a dessert auction. This year, our event is themed \"Derby Day\" and will see guests wearing their best Kentucky Derby attire! We are looking for volunteers that would be willing to help during set-up (10am-2pm), break-down (9pm-10pm), during the event (5pm-9pm) with guest check-in, merchandise sales, silent auction bids, dessert auction bids and distribution, and general clean-up during the event.",

Trails and Rails volunteers provide an interpretive program aboard Amtrak’s Coast Starlight between San Jose and San Luis Obispo. Most of the program takes place in the Sightseer Lounge car aboard the Coast Starlight. Guides are expected to volunteer a minimum of one day per month, May through September. (The program is inactive October through April.) We travel between San Jose and Paso Robles, beginning and ending at the San Jose Diridon Station the same day. Hours are approximately 9:30 am to 8:30 pm. Saturdays or Sundays. Potential Trails and Rails volunteers attend an initial day-long classroom training at the start of their first season, then continue their education by observing and assisting seasoned guides in peer-to-peer learning on the train. Written materials, historical articles, and related websites round out each guide’s training and continuing education. For more information, and an opportunity to sign up for a no-obligation orientation, go to https://anzaguides.org/about-the-trails-rails-program/",

We connect skilled professionals to verified eco-projects, providing the guidance, infrastructure, and knowledge needed for small organizations to create environmental solutions for their communities. The outreach committee welcomes new project makers and project supports, generally overseeing the management of EcoWB partnerships. There is a diverse range of assignments for skilled volunteers, depending on your specialty and interest. We are accepting applications from not those with 1 year plus of outreach, communication, or project coordination experience, as well as any outgoing trained ecologists. Positions are flexible, requiring as little as five hours/month of service for participating in committee business. We are meeting and operating within Western Hemisphere timezones. As we continue to grow our organization and build capacity, we are looking to train the next generation of EcoWB volunteers to help us organize a close-knit global network of scientists and project makers. You may specialize in supporting our developing projects, working with consulting firms, or our partnership agreements. Members attend a monthly meeting and have regular communications with the Co-Chairs. You will co-design one or more monthly assignments with us which you may choose to accept, depending on your availability.",

The work happens from September to April when the terns are not present. Activities include pulling out invasive plants, changing out the substrate, and refurbishing the tern shelters. We will assemble at the main refuge gate, and all materials are provided (please, however, bring work gloves if you have them). Please come and join us for a wonderful day out at our urban refuge! Meeting location: Located on the northwest portion of the former Alameda Naval Air Station, just east of the city of Oakland. Email us for directions.",

Help us work towards our mission of building community, connecting people with nature, and protecting and enhancing Mount Sutro, one of the city’s wildest and most beautiful green spaces. About Sutro Stewards Sutro Stewards’ mission is to build community, connect people with nature, and protect and enhance Mount Sutro. Currently, the nursery grows over 180 different species, and houses over 4,000 plants in total. Project Requirements & Important Notes Wear clothes that can get dirty! Long pants and long-sleeved shirts to protect your legs and arms while working and sturdy, closed-toe shoes. Some work areas may have poison oak and arriving in appropriate clothing limits exposure risk. If you have a known sensitivity, please alert a crew leader prior to starting work. After program, we welcome you to join us for pizza and refreshments (on us!) starting around 12:15pm. We will meet in the Woods Lot located at 100 Medical Center Way. Parking is available in the Woods Lot parking lot only. Once you RSVP, we will be reaching out to you with a more in depth info packet and two participation waivers. . Please plan to arrive 15 minutes early to fill out waivers onsite if needed. Please email info@sutrostewards.org with any questions or concerns!\" Please do your part in keeping our community healthy. If you are immuno-compromised, at increased risk for severe illness, or feeling sick at all, please decline your registration to the event and register for a project at a less risky time. For additional resources and guidance on how to keep yourself healthy, visit the CDC website. If you are interested in signing up as a group, please email sarah@handsonbayarea.org. For a one-time $50 group sign-up fee, we can assist your team with signing up and coordinating with the agency partner for possible accommodation.",

Program topics include: * Animals (Nov-Feb) - Fish, birds, marine mammals & Bay scientist * Low Tide (March-June) - Explore the rocky shoreline & docks * Sailing (March-May) - Students experience the Bay on a sailboat. * Summer programs featuring Marine Biology & Boating weeks Our training begins in October 2024 and continues until March 2025. It involves hands-on training sessions covering such topics such as the history of the Bay, marine habitats, and bayshore flora & fauna, with special emphasis on how to teach and use artifacts and live animals. Trainings are ongoing; you may join the program at any time during the year. The cost is $10 per training Bay Interpretive Training | City of Berkeley (berkeleyca.gov)",

      "input": "RESULTS is a movement of passionate, committed, everyday people. Together, we use our voices to influence political decisions that will bring an end to poverty in the U.S. and around the world. RESULTS advocates believe that everyone deserves a chance to thrive in their community. No one should worry about being hungry or losing the safety of their home. But too many people in the U.S. and around the world face this reality each day. To build a better future, we must take action to protect people's rights to health, nutrition, housing, and financial stability. You can make a difference as a RESULTS advocate. Every year, RESULTS volunteers secure billions of dollars for global health and education. We ensure that U.S. households with low incomes can access vital nutrition support. We improve tax policies for people with low incomes, putting money back in their pockets. And we call for new and innovative solutions to the affordable housing crisis. Learn how you can be an effective advocate. Sign up for your 1-hour New Advocate Orientation at www.results.org/volunteer. What You’ll Do as a new RESULTS Advocate In our New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will join one training and action meeting each month. During the meeting, you will learn one advocacy skill and take one advocacy action to practice that skill and support a solution to poverty. RESULTS New Member Engagement staff lead these meetings. Our staff specialize in grassroots advocacy and community organizing. We are eager to support you to grow as an advocate. Through the New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will reach the following goals: Learn to speak powerfully about solutions to poverty in the U.S . including: Protecting and expanding SNAP and U.S. nutrition assistance programs. Improving tax policies that help low-income households, such as the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. Creating new solutions for renters who are struggling to afford housing. Learn to speak powerfully about global poverty solutions , including: U.S. support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria and the need for U.S. partnership worldwide to ensure access to healthcare. Securing U.S. funding for programs that improve global maternal and child health and nutrition and strengthenhealth systems globally. Communicate effectively and confidently with each of your members of Congress. Share your values and your concerns about poverty. Ask them to support effective solutions. Write and publish media in your local newspaper . This media will educate and influence Congress and your local community. Use your community connections, and build new ones, to show a strong, united force for positive change. After you finish the New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will be ready to t ake your advocacy to the next level . We'll connect you with other advocates in your state. As part of your local RESULTS chapter, you will have opportunities to join meetings with your members of Congress and continue to make a difference through advocacy. Take Action to Create a Better Future Actions we take today will shape the future for generations to come. By taking one action each month, you can ensure that our leaders understand your community's needs and hopes for a better world. Ready to take effective actions that will help us build a bright future? Sign up for your 1-hour New Advocate Orientation at www.results.org/volunteer.",

Are you an active or inactive attorney looking to share your legal knowledge with the under served community? Are you ready to empower clients and make a difference in your community? Our clients come to us because they have a civil, legal matter for which they need guidance. We see spouses looking for advice regarding divorce and single parents needing counsel on visitation and child support. We see elderly clients who have been victims of fraud and those who have lost what little they had to predatory lenders. We deal with landlord/tenant situations, contract disputes, custody enforcement, and many other civil issues. Volunteer attorneys provide brief advice, counsel, pro se coaching and referral in a 30-45 minute client appointment. Maximum 3-4 hours per month. Without our services, many would do nothing about their situation which often turns into a major and complex issue. Any time you're willing to give makes a tremendous difference to those we serve!",

As an ELC member, you will work closely with the NAMIWalks Manager and Event Chair to cultivate relationships with local businesses and secure sponsorships and corporate teams that support NAMI’s mission. About NAMI San Mateo County & NAMIWalks The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) San Mateo County provides free mental health education, support, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental health conditions. NAMIWalks San Mateo County is an annual event that brings together our community to raise funds and awareness for mental health. Sponsorships and corporate teams play a critical role in ensuring the event’s success and sustaining our free programs. Volunteer Roles - Sponsorship & Corporate Engagement We are seeking dedicated volunteers to help us prospect, engage, and secure corporate sponsors and teams. You can contribute in one or more of these key areas: Prospecting: Research and identify businesses, foundations, and organizations that align with our mission. Build a list of potential sponsors and corporate team partners. Outreach: Make the first connection. Reach out via email, phone, or LinkedIn to introduce NAMIWalks and gauge interest in sponsorship and team participation. Asking: Make the official sponsorship ask, present partnership benefits, and secure funding or in-kind donations. Provide support to sponsors and corporate teams to ensure they feel engaged. Key Responsibilities Generate monetary and in-kind sponsorships to support NAMIWalks. Create and execute a sponsorship and corporate team engagement plan in partnership with the NAMIWalks Manager and Event Chair. Ensure clear communication with the committee to avoid duplicate outreach and maximize sponsor engagement. Monitor progress toward sponsorship and team recruitment goals. Support sponsors in forming and growing their NAMIWalks teams. Ensure all sponsorship benefits are fulfilled and properly documented. Who Should Apply? Comfortable networking, making asks, or securing financial commitments. Passion for mental health awareness and community impact. Willingness to research new companies. Great organizational and communication skills. Time Commitment & Location This is a flexible, remote-friendly opportunity that mostly meets virtually with some occasional in-person meeting. The work load typically requires 1-3 hours per week, with time increasing as NAMIWalks approaches. The ELC meets bi-monthly, and additional outreach efforts can be done on your own schedule. If you are interested in the volunteer opportunity, please fill out this form and we will be in touch with next steps: https://forms.gle/AJG3Snxza6dF94TY9 Questions?
