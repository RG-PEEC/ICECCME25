There is more information listed there as well, including information about our pairing process. (You do not need to indicate your interest through VolunteerMatch unless you have specific questions.) Thank you! Background: Pandemic Professors, a 501c3 organization, was founded in April 2020 with the mission of facilitating free online tutoring to students in underserved communities affected by the pandemic. We are a 100% volunteer-based organization. Our philosophy not only supports academic achievement but also emphasizes the importance of socio-emotional health. We rely on committed volunteers who have a passion for education and are dedicated to offering academic support to students at risk of falling behind. Your contribution is crucial in this endeavor!  You will interact with families and help students perform and learn! Join our organization and help us empower our students as we lay a foundation for lifelong learning. Being an online tutor: As a tutor, you are the lifeblood of this organization and are the one delivering services. We will pair you with a student who needs support in whichever standard K-12 subjects you want to teach (i.e., English, math, science, social studies, languages). You will interact with families and help your student(s) perform and learn! We are looking for coding tutors, as we have seen the benefits and need for under-resourced students to gain skills related to the tech industry. We are also looking for ESL tutors to support our growing Spanish-speaking population. To apply as a tutor, please copy and paste this link to your browser to reach us directly. (It only takes 2 mins to fill out!):  https://forms.gle/Q7UgbKVSwyCBNkfA7 Application Requirements: - College Transcript - Online Mandated Reporter Training - Professional Reference(s) Volunteer Requirements: - 2 or more hours per week commitment (flexibility for job requirements, midterms and finals) - Tutoring experience is helpful but not required. We offer guidelines and support. Responsibilities: - Engage and support students in their learning journey, covering subjects based on individual student needs - Collaborate with other volunteers and program coordinators to ensure effective tutoring sessions - Maintain records of student progress and provide feedback to students and supervisors Benefits of joining Pandemic Professors: -Improve diversity & inclusion in the tech industry by fostering hard skills and a sense of belonging in students from communities who are historically under-represented. -Learn by teaching! Teaching others is a great way to improve your own skills. Teach at many levels, from introductory coding in languages like Scratch to more advanced levels (e.g., Python, Java) -Flexible schedule: volunteer any day of the week, any time of day, wherever you are! We have volunteers from around the globe and students in many different time zones. -Get recognized for your volunteer work with letters of recommendation for college, grad school; references for job applications; and more! This is not only a way to help those in need and to benefit your personal resume, but also a way to build community. We are here to support each other through this time as well and hope you join us! If you would like to volunteer as a tutor, are interested in volunteer staff positions or have questions of any kind, please contact community.outreach@pandemicprofessors.org. About PANDEMIC PROFESSORS, INC. Location: 512 W 156th St., Apt 22, New York City, NY 10032, US Mission Statement: The mission of Pandemic Professors is to facilitate free tutoring to children in low-income communities impacted by the pandemic. Description: At Pandemic Professors (Pan Prof), we believe all K-12 students deserve an opportunity to receive free supplemental learning through private tutoring, in order to help them remain on track and meet their educational goals. Our organization was founded to match underserved students across the United States with free online tutors. Historically, students in underserved communities are at greater risk of falling behind in academics and socio-emotional skills. Much like Hurricane Katrina, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the plethora of academic and personal challenges these students already face. Our organization presents students in low-income communities with opportunities to strengthen subject comprehension and boost confidence. The needs, strengths, and voices of the impacted students drive our family-centered philosophy and evidence-based practices. Together with our partners, Pan Prof combats adverse effects on learning resulting from the pandemic and exacerbated by poverty. Students in underserved communities don’t lack a hunger for knowledge, they lack the means to access quality tutoring.

"Looking for volunteers for the 2025-2026 school year. To learn more and apply, visit: http://www.mindsmatterbay.org/join/ ABOUT OUR PROGRAM Minds Matter Bay Area is a 100% volunteer-run, educational non-profit that provides low-income students access to strong mentors, instructors and leaders, who help broaden their worldview and prepare them for college and beyond. Students join us as Sophomores, where they build up their academic foundations in math, science, reading, writing and critical thinking, and learn key life skills, like leadership and public speaking. As Juniors, our students focus on improving standardized test scores, managing stress and exploring colleges. During the summers after their sophomore and junior years, we encourage and support our students with finding summer programs at different colleges around the country to push them out of their comfort zones and ready them for college. Finally, as Seniors, our students focus heavily on showcasing their best selves in their college applications and learning more key skills that will ensure that they don’t just graduate from college, but that they thrive during their experience. We also support them with learning about both traditional and creative ways of paying for college, so that finances don't become a barrier to considering a great school. We’re looking for volunteers to help us with every part of this program from tutoring to mentoring to managing programs. At the heart of our organization are people committed to making an impact in education and these students’ lives. At Minds Matter Bay Area, our mentees come first, but our strong community comes in at a close second. Many of our volunteers form lasting friendships and embark on new endeavors together. Whether we’re discussing the latest trends in education over dinner or picnicking in Golden Gate Park, our community knows how to get things done and have fun while doing it. We invite you to join our community and our cause. VOLUNTEER COMMITMENT The opportunity to make an impact on a student’s life comes with important responsibilities. When working with youth, one of the key components to building trust is just showing up. Commitment is key with our program-your presence, proactive communication, and conscientiousness are what makes Minds Matter Bay Area work. Sessions take place from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM every Saturday during the school year (August through May, with breaks following standard school holidays) For Sophomores and Juniors, instructional programs take place from 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and mentoring from 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM For Seniors, college application prep takes place from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM We require a minimum attendance of 80% of Saturday sessions (approx. 20 of 25 weeks from August through May) and advanced notice of planned absences Building strong relationships with a student is vital for their success and growth, so we strongly prefer a three-year commitment, though we require a minimum of one year INSTRUCTORS The instructional component of our programs is designed to equip students with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for achieving academic success at school and in their standardized tests. Our instructors serve as guides and role models for our students, encouraging them to deepen their knowledge base and to enjoy the process of learning.

Mentors work with their students to explore different majors and career paths and learn a variety of skills, like writing resumes and personal statements, managing time and stress, and presenting and discussing a perspective. Our mentors serve as positive role models and catalysts for the students, encouraging them to fulfill their full potential.

space for difficult conversations and being available outside of session Inquisitive and curious about what motivates and excites people Adaptable to a wide variety of personality types, from

Speaking to passengers in the Sightseer Lounge aboard Amtrak's Coast Starlight The Trails and Rails program is a collaboration between the National Park Service and Amtrak. Trails and Rails volunteers provide an interpretive program aboard Amtrak’s Coast Starlight between San Jose and San Luis Obispo. Most of the program takes place in the Sightseer Lounge car aboard the Coast Starlight. Guides are expected to volunteer a minimum of one day per month, May through September. (The program is inactive October through April.) We travel between San Jose and Paso Robles, beginning and ending at the San Jose Diridon Station the same day. Hours are approximately 9:30 am to 8:30 pm. Saturdays or Sundays. Potential Trails and Rails volunteers attend an initial day-long classroom training at the start of their first season, then continue their education by observing and assisting seasoned guides in peer-to-peer learning on the train. Written materials, historical articles, and related websites round out each guide’s training and continuing education.

RESULTS is a movement of passionate, committed, everyday people. Together, we use our voices to influence political decisions that will bring an end to poverty in the U.S. and around the world. RESULTS advocates believe that everyone deserves a chance to thrive in their community. No one should worry about being hungry or losing the safety of their home. But too many people in the U.S. and around the world face this reality each day. To build a better future, we must take action to protect people's rights to health, nutrition, housing, and financial stability. You can make a difference as a RESULTS advocate. Every year, RESULTS volunteers secure billions of dollars for global health and education. We ensure that U.S. households with low incomes can access vital nutrition support. We improve tax policies for people with low incomes, putting money back in their pockets. And we call for new and innovative solutions to the affordable housing crisis. Learn how you can be an effective advocate. Sign up for your 1-hour New Advocate Orientation at www.results.org/volunteer. What You’ll Do as a new RESULTS Advocate In our New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will join one training and action meeting each month. During the meeting, you will learn one advocacy skill and take one advocacy action to practice that skill and support a solution to poverty. RESULTS New Member Engagement staff lead these meetings. Our staff specialize in grassroots advocacy and community organizing. We are eager to support you to grow as an advocate. Through the New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will reach the following goals: Learn to speak powerfully about solutions to poverty in the U.S . including: Protecting and expanding SNAP and U.S. nutrition assistance programs. Improving tax policies that help low-income households, such as the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. Creating new solutions for renters who are struggling to afford housing. Learn to speak powerfully about global poverty solutions , including: U.S. support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria and the need for U.S. partnership worldwide to ensure access to healthcare. Securing U.S. funding for programs that improve global maternal and child health and nutrition and strengthenhealth systems globally. Communicate effectively and confidently with each of your members of Congress. Share your values and your concerns about poverty. Ask them to support effective solutions. Write and publish media in your local newspaper . This media will educate and influence Congress and your local community. Use your community connections, and build new ones, to show a strong, united force for positive change. After you finish the New Advocate Training & Action Program, you will be ready to t ake your advocacy to the next level . We'll connect you with other advocates in your state. As part of your local RESULTS chapter, you will have opportunities to join meetings with your members of Congress and continue to make a difference through advocacy. Take Action to Create a Better Future Actions we take today will shape the future for generations to come. By taking one action each month, you can ensure that our leaders understand your community's needs and hopes for a better world.
